# Academic Outcome Predictor

The Academic Outcome Predictor is a simple Python University Project to calculate progression outcomes of students.
It calculates the academic standing based on the total credits earned in different categories.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Global and Local Variables:**
    - Use of global variables (`progress_count`, `trailer_count`, etc.) to maintain state across different parts of the
      program.
    - Local variables within functions to store temporary data.

2. **Functions:**
    - Modularization of code through
      functions (`horizontalSeparator`, `get_input`, `horizontal_histogram`, `vertical_histogram`, `main`).
    - Functions for better organization, readability, and reusability.

3. **Conditional Statements:**
    - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to determine progression outcomes based on input marks.
    - Use of logical operators (`&`, `>=`, `in`, `range`) in conditions.

4. **Data Storage (Python Lists):**
    - Use of lists (`lst`) to store and manage multiple sets of data.
    - Lists for storing progression outcome details.

5. **Loops:**
    - Use of `while` loops to control the flow of the program until certain conditions are met.
    - Nested loops for input validation and user interaction.

6. **Exception Handling:**
    - Handling exceptions with `try` and `except` for input validation.
    - Ensuring the user enters valid integers for input.
