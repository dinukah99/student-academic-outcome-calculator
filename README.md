# Academic Outcome Calculator

The Academic Outcome Predictor is a simple Python University Project designed to calculate progression outcomes of students.
It determines the academic standing based on the total credits earned in different categories.

## Key Concepts:

1. **Functions and Local Variables:**
    - Modularization of code through functions (`horizontalSeparator`, `get_input`, `horizontal_histogram`, `vertical_histogram`, `main`).
    - Functions are utilized for better organization, readability, and reusability.
    - Local variables within functions store temporary data, avoiding the use of unnecessary global variables.

2. **Conditional Statements:**
    - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are employed to determine progression outcomes based on input marks.
    - Logical operators (`&`, `>=`, `in`, `range`) are utilized in conditions.

3. **Data Storage (Python Lists):**
    - Lists (`lst`) are employed to store and manage multiple sets of data.
    - Lists are utilized for storing progression outcome details.

4. **Loops:**
    - `while` loops are used to control the flow of the program until certain conditions are met.
    - Nested loops handle input validation and user interaction.

5. **Exception Handling:**
    - Exceptions are handled using `try` and `except` for input validation.
    - Ensuring the user enters valid integers for input.

This project emphasizes the importance of modular programming, effective use of functions, and proper data organization to enhance code maintainability and readability.
